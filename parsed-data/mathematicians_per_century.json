    "10 BC": "Very few specific mathematicians are known from the 10 BC century. Notable figures include:\n\n1. **Pythagoras** (c. 570\u2013495 BC) - Although he predates the 10 BC century, he influenced mathematics significantly.  \n2. **Euclid** (c. 300 BC) - Also earlier but foundational in geometry.  \n\nMathematical activity was more concentrated in earlier periods, with less documentation from the 10 BC era.",
    "9 BC": "There are no well-documented famous mathematicians specifically from the 9 BC century. Notable figures in mathematics emerge later, such as:\n\n- Thales of Miletus (c. 624\u2013546 BC)\n- Pythagoras (c. 570\u2013495 BC)\n\nThe 9 BC time frame lacks prominent mathematicians recognized today.",
